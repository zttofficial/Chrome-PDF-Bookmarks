# Chrome-PDF-Bookmarks
Add bookmarks to the native Chrome PDF viewer.

No more ideas about new chrome extensions at the moment, so I didn't pay the registration fee to become a developer. Please download the .crx file from **Releases** for local installation.



### TODO

There is not a reliable way to retrieve current page number in native Chrome PDF viewer.

The stored bookmarks are also a global variable that has not been matched with different pdf files.
